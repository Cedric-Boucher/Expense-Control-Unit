## Importing Existing Data
See [Expense-Control-Unit-Converter](https://github.com/Cedric-Boucher/Expense-Control-Unit-Converter) for an example Python script to convert your existing transaction data into the format expected by ECU. Or, write something yourself from scratch, the format is self-explanatory if you create at least one transaction and export data. Note that ID values are not used for import, and so they can be omitted.
